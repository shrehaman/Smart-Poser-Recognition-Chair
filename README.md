# Smart Poser Recognition Chair (IOT)


The Posture Recognition System with Real-Time Data Visualization is a project that utilizes sensors and a machine learning model to recognize and classify good and bad postures. The system captures real-time data from sensors attached to the chair and processes it using a trained machine learning model. The project also includes a web-based visualization component that displays the captured data and provides real-time feedback to the user.
